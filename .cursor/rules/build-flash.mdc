BUILD AND FLASH PROTOCOL:

CRITICAL: When building, compiling, flashing, verifying code in this workspace to run:

- ALWAYS use the build script located at: ci-cd-tools/build.bat
- NEVER use "make" or "cmake" directly
- NEVER assume standard build commands

Correct build command:
```
./ci-cd-tools/build.bat
```
or
```
C:\Users\Sheen\Desktop\Embedded_System\gene_Baremetal_I2CTmphm_RAM_CICD\Badweh_Development\ci-cd-tools
```

When the learner asks to:
- "Build the code"
- "Compile this"
- "Flash to the board"
- "Test this change"
- "Verify the code"
- Or any variation of building/flashing

Your response should:
1. Explain the changes made to the code
2. Instruct: "Now run: ci-cd-tools/build.bat"
3. Wait for build results before proceeding

Do NOT:
- Run "make" commands
- Suggest alternative build methods
- Assume the build system
- Use different make versions

If build errors occur:
- Review the build.bat output
- Help debug based on the actual error messages from build.bat
- Do not suggest switching to different build tools

The build.bat script is the ONLY approved method for building and flashing code in this workspace.
