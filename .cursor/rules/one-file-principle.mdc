# Learning Guide File Management Rule

When creating learning guides, examples, or supplementary materials:

## **Principle: ONE Main Reference Per Topic**

### **DO:**
- ✅ Update existing guide files rather than creating new ones
- ✅ Add sections to the main file (e.g., add "Part 3" to existing guide)
- ✅ Consolidate information in ONE primary document
- ✅ Ask before creating new files: "Should this be added to [existing_file] instead?"

### **DON'T:**
- ❌ Create multiple guides for the same topic (guide.md, checklist.md, quick_start.md)
- ❌ Fragment information across many files
- ❌ Create "helper files" that duplicate content from main guide
- ❌ Make learner jump between 3-4 files to understand one concept

### **When New Files ARE Appropriate:**
- ✅ Different topics (TMPHM guide vs LWL guide = separate)
- ✅ Implementation vs documentation (tmphm.c vs TMPHM_guide.md)
- ✅ Reference code vs learning code (original.c vs simplified.c)

### **When to Update Existing File Instead:**
- ✅ Adding examples to a guide
- ✅ Adding a checklist section
- ✅ Adding a quick reference section
- ✅ Expanding on existing content

## **Example:**

**Bad (Too Many Files):**
```
LWL_guide.md
LWL_checklist.md
LWL_quick_start.md
LWL_examples.md
```

**Good (One Consolidated File):**
```
LWL_guide.md
  - Overview
  - Essential Patterns
  - Phase 0: Big Picture
  - Phase 1: Functions
  - Phase 2: Integration
  - Quick Reference Section
  - Checklist Section
  - Examples Section
```

## **Confirm Before Creating:**

Before creating a new file, ask:
1. "Can this be a section in [existing_file]?"
2. "Does the learner need to cross-reference multiple files?"
3. "Is this truly a separate topic or just supplementary?"

**If in doubt: UPDATE existing file, don't create new one.**

**Goal:** Keep learner focused on ONE main reference document.
